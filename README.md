##  Caesar Cipher Decrypt script
This project, from [CIL Academy](cil.academy), is a simple Python script for decrypting messages using a basic encryption algorithm.
It is a simple substitution cipher, based on the Caesar Cipher.

Here is the [Rubric]("CIL_Academy\Python-Code-Challenge-1-M2W1.pdf") to the project.
The solutions to the project can be found [here](../PythonCryptography/solutions.md)

## Features

- Supports encryption using a key-based algorithm
- Supports decryption of encrypted messages
- Calculates the decryption time of each message

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system
3. Run the script using the command `python decrypt.py`

## Usage

1. Enter a ciphertext to decrypt when prompted
2. Enter a key between 1 and 10 to decrypt the message
3. The script will output the decrypted message and the decryption time
